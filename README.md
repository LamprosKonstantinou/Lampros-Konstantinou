# Lampros-Konstantinou
👋 Welcome to my profile!

I am an undergraduate student in Applied Informatics in University of Macedonia with a passion for programming and software development. Here, you'll find personal projects that I've developed, mainly in Java, as well as other software implementation projects.

📚 What you'll find:

-Personal Java projects that I’m working on as I continue learning and growing as a developer.
-Projects related to software implementation methodologies and techniques.
-My thesis project, which I have completed independently.

✨ My goal is to keep improving, learning new things, and contributing to the open-source community. If you're interested in seeing more or collaborating, feel free to reach out!
